# modWorm

modWorm is a generic modeling framework for modular simulation of neural connectomics, dynamics and biomechanics of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans).
\
\
modWorm enables fully modular construction and simulation of C. elegans neural connectomics, dynamics, biomechanics and the environment. modWorm employs a modular hierarchical modeling pipeline where users can freely combine smaller models (e.g., individual biophysical processes) to construct larger models (e.g., nervous system) in an efficient and intuitive manner. 
\
\
The constructed model is customizable and is reusable. The underlying components can be edited or exchanged within the framework interface. modWorm has been developed as a compact all-in-one Python library with support for Julia backbone to achieve high-performance efficient simulation. The framework currently includes scenarios for simulating the nervous system, muscles and body of C. elegans as detailed in [citation below].
